"""
Systematic probe: how does the cylinder grid lookup behave when
sensors are not exactly on the wall?

The sensor → grid-cell assignment in
``lucid.propagation.cylinder.assign_sensors_to_grid`` classifies a
sensor as "on the wall" only when

    | sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - R |  <=  sensor_radius

A sensor further off the nominal wall than ``sensor_radius`` fails
all three branch tests (on_wall / on_top / on_bottom) and falls
through to the no-assignment return: it is silently invisible to
the grid lookup, and rays will never find it.

These tests pin that behaviour down so the snap-to-wall default in
:meth:`Cylinder.from_pmt_file` cannot regress without us noticing.
